            <strong>Presentation.-</strong> EBSI Platform is a peer to peer network of
            interconnected nodes of two types:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>EBSI nodes at European level, operate by the Commission</li>
            <li>
              EBSI nodes at a national level, operate by following Member States: Italy, Spain,
              Belgium, France, Sweden, Austria, Malta.

              include generic capabilities and connectivity to Blockchain networks.
            </li>

            <strong>EBSI V1.0 Stack Nodes</strong>
            <br />
            EBSI 1.0 is a public permissioned network that requires EBSI full-stack nodes
            infrastructure, with several distributed validator nodes, basic redundancy, capacity to
            handle smart contracts, run transactions on those smart-contracts, with access control
            mechanism on them (Note: access control on smart contracts may not be all the time a
            core feature as it may imply wide type of implementations).
            <br />
            All the members of the consortium (network) will use the same open-source EBSI Stack
            Node template. Each member of the network will activate/deactivate any module
            (container) of the Stack Node Template, based on the predefined agreement in respect to
            the use cases that will be implemented.
            <br />
            For EBSI v1.0, the nodes will run on the host operating system Linux. A single Stack
            Node template is composed of a set of containers, that can be run with different
            containers managers (Docker has been selected for the V1.0) and that can be deployed on
            Virtual Machines node.
            <br />
            To setup the EBSI v1.0 network, a minimum set of redundant nodes will be deployed by
            DIGIT for the European Commission. While European Commission will utilize its own
            infrastructure provider (based on the existing Cloud Framework contract), each Member
            State will define one or more contributing entities that will setup an EBSI node
            directly within their existing premises or through their own provider. All European
            Commission&#8217;s nodes will be implemented on VM machines in the cloud, spread in
            different European geo-locations as depicted below.
            <br />
            At any time EBSI team may (and will) assess the overall structure of EBSI in order to
            ensure full decentralization and avoid concentration of nodes (e.g. in a specific member
            state or managed by a specific cloud provider).
            <br />
            All bare metal VM machines used for the EBSI v1.0 Stack Nodes will have the following
            minimum technical requirements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>4vCPU</li>
            <li>16G RAM</li>
            <li>1TB SSD</li>
            <li>Linux OS</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Inside each EBSI bare-metal VM node, each sub-component will run in a dedicated docker
            container. Ubuntu server 18.04 LTS will be used for the docker container OS. If the
            Member State will also handle specific services managing application capabilities,
            additional computer infrastructure may be needed. Whenever Member States/Entities will
            have their existing business logic running in their IT Infrastructure, EBSI Application
            API/Libraries will require to be installed on their environment in order to permit their
            existing business process to integrate with EBSI Network infrastructure.
            <br />
            The Stack Nodes will be interconnected with each other at containers level.
